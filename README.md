### Hello there!
---
I'm passionate about **Data science** and **Machine learning**. I've completed Skillbox course âœ¨Data Scientist PROâœ¨ (link). Also I've a master's degree in management.  

I am proficient in:  
* Collect, clean and preprocess data to train predictive ML models.
* Conduct EDA and Feature engineering to understand the nature of data and improve model quality
* Train ML models and create pipelines to make them run efficiently

My tech stack:  
* Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, PySpark, Airflow, Flask, FastAPI, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Hyperopt, CatBoost, PyCharm  
* Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, Git, Bash, Docker, SQL, DBeaver, MS Excel, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, Power BI, Grafana  

So, I'm kind of a Machine Learning EngineerðŸ˜„

- ðŸ”­ Right now I'm improving my skills as a data scientist  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TenserFlow and Plotly closely, Also I plan to learn other useful libraries too
